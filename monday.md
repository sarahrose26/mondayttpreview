#### Students have expressed a desire to have more experience with: 
*Git and Github
*Reading a JSON file to the view of an Express app
*Ajax and Jquery

#### Schedule:
*1:30-3pm: Edwin leads Git/Github collaboration workshop and Angjelin leads JSON/Express workshop

*3pm-4pm: Ajax and Jquery walkthrough

#### Resources:
*Github: You can use this repository, which has a master branch and 4 issues that need to be resolved: [Pusheenburger](https://github.com/sarahrose26/pusheenburger)

*Reading a JSON file in Express: You can step through the assignment where they were asked to do this, which is still on canvas. [Message Board App](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1256936/assignments/7613755)

*Ajax and Jquery: I really like this walkthrough on Treehouse, which you could do together. [Github API Workshop with Ajax and Jquery](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/code-a-simple-github-api-webapp-using-jquery-ajax)

*With Ajax and Jquery you can also demonstrate why/when you may want to use it vs. pure Javascript.

# GIVE THEM AS MUCH HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE AS POSSIBLE!! LESS SHOWING, MORE DOING!
